# Timelines

## [2023-09-25T10:47:35.0595842+02:00]
Since you are on a limited timeline, I propose a limited schedule to make sure that we keep moving.  Here's what I think we should accomplish this week:

|Day|Tasks|
|-|-|
|Monday|<ul><li>find suitable overleaf template and start project</li><li>add me to overleaf as editor</li></ul>|
|Tuesday|<ul><li>you should review the new codebase</li><li>the paper should have an *outline*</li><li>come up with three questions you have about the code and your paper</li></ul>|
|Wednesday|<ul><li>in the morning we'll have a call to discuss your questions and make sure we are both on the same page</li><li>afterwards you should have plenty of work</li></ul>|
|Thursday||
|Friday|<ul><li>by the end of the day you have made at least one commit towards your final goal</li></ul>|

By *outline* of your paper I mean that you should have some basic sections labeled:
* abstract
* introduction
* related work
* title of the main body
* experiements
* discussion/conclusion
